Introduction
----------------
I usually have a lot of different bash scripts lying around and I felt it might be a good idea to put them in one place together so I can more easily expand and improve my script code base.

.bashrc
----------------
I prefer, instead of editing `.bashrc`, to put any changes I like for the prompt in `.bash_aliases`.
Anything more complex than a single (or a couple) of lines I put in .bashrc.d and include from
`.bash_aliases`
