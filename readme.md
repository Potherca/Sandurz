Introduction
----------------
I usually have a lot of different bash scripts lying around and I felt it might 
be a good idea to put them in one place together so I can more easily expand and 
improve my script code base.

I also have a *very* basic installer for my `.bashrc` and `.gitconfig` files 
(use at your own risk).

.bashrc
----------------
I prefer, instead of editing `.bashrc`, to put any changes I like for the prompt 
in `.bash_aliases`. Anything more complex than a single (or a couple) of lines I 
put in .bashrc.d and include from `.bash_aliases`

.gitconfig
----------------
My git config file has some aliases I got used to from using SVN (like st/ci/co) 
and some nice colours for the diff, graph, log and stat commands
